Hi, this app is out now! You can check it out, by following link below and installing it on android system 5.0 or newer.

What is this app about?
It's basically compass with some additional features: like input address or just coordinates and it shows you direction and distance from your current position.
This app is completely free and adfree as I've done it just for me and just wanted to share it.

Ofcourse there are some bugs and features I have to fix or develop but it's going to take some time because of lack of time.
